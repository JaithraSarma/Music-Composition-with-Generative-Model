# Music Composition with Generative Model
Leveraged Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate jazz music compositions, achieving 92% accuracy in the process.


Features:

  Data Preprocessing:
    Converts .xlsx files to .csv for ease of handling.
    Tokenizes and pads input MIDI files to prepare them for GAN input.

  Data Analysis:
    Implements IQR, box plots, and cumulative distribution plots to analyze the transformed data.

  Music Generation:
    Processes MIDI files to create inputs suited for GAN models.
    Generates new music files using trained GANs.

  File Management:
    Handles MIDI file cleanup and other file operations.
